# fsmiddleton-excess_enthalpy

This repository will contain all code, in MATLAB and perhaps Python, related to my masters topic of the prediction of excess enthalpy data using matrix completion methods.

The ToyProblemMatrixCompletion is a toy problem of both a synthesised matrix and a larger, complete matrix, where Principle component analysis (PCA) with singular value decomposition (SVD) is completed. This was done to verify the method I am using. Validating the code using smaller and known matrices reduces the chances of errors later and helps with understanding the method.

The Regression code will include code for regressing the experimental excess enthalpy data for it to be filled into the matrices when that portion of the project begins.
